# SHOY
### SHOY - a 2d-platformer multi platform game in QML and V-Play engine I created in collaboration with other students in small group during summer internship in Mobica. 

Saved in my repository to fix some bugs and maybe end it in free time (the game is not completely finished).

At current stage:
* you can play on a few prepared levels (only testing levels)
* level editor (creator) works fine
* multiplayer works fine (with watermark because of no license :( )
* nice graphics and sound
* menu is working really slow at the beginning
* score is saved in cloud-synchronised leaderboards
